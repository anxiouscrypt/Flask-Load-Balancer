1. Expand Load Balancing Algorithms

    Add other load balancing strategies (beyond round-robin) that users can choose between:
        Least Connections: Route traffic to the server with the fewest active connections. This approach is ideal when some servers are busier than others.
        Weighted Round-Robin: Use weights to favor certain servers based on their processing power.
        IP Hashing: Use client IP addresses to determine which server to send requests to, ensuring the same client connects to the same server.

2. Add Rate Limiting

    Integrate rate limiting to prevent any one user or client from overloading the load balancer.
    Rate limiting can be applied based on IP addresses or custom headers and can block or throttle traffic that exceeds a certain threshold.
    This demonstrates the ability to implement traffic control and resource management.

3. Implement SSL/TLS Encryption

    Add HTTPS support to secure the connection between the client and the load balancer.
    Use Let’s Encrypt or self-signed certificates to enable SSL/TLS. Flask’s built-in server doesn’t support HTTPS natively, so you could consider using a reverse proxy (like Nginx) or a library (like ssl) for this purpose.

4. Introduce Caching for Performance Optimization

    Implement a basic cache to store frequently requested data from the backend servers, reducing the load on the backend servers.
    Use in-memory caching (e.g., a Python dictionary) or integrate with a caching tool like Redis.
    Adding caching demonstrates understanding of performance tuning and resource efficiency.

5. Create a Management Dashboard

    Build a web interface to display current backend servers, their health status, and load-balancing statistics (like requests handled).
    Use a frontend framework (like React or Vue.js) or a simple HTML/JavaScript setup to show real-time data from the load balancer API.
    This will make your project more user-friendly and visually engaging, and it gives you experience with full-stack development.

6. Add a Load Testing Suite

    Perform load testing on your load balancer using tools like Apache JMeter or Locust to measure its performance under different traffic loads.
    Track metrics like response times, throughput, and error rates to analyze your load balancer’s scalability and robustness.
    Reporting the results of your load tests in the documentation adds credibility to the project.

7. Containerize the Load Balancer with Docker

    Create a Dockerfile for the load balancer and each backend server, and use docker-compose to manage everything.
    This step will make your project portable and easy to deploy on any machine or cloud provider.
    Docker and containerization are valuable skills in production environments, and this setup will make your project easy to share.

8. Deploy on the Cloud

    Deploy your containerized application to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    Consider using Kubernetes for orchestration to gain experience with cluster management and scaling.
    Cloud deployment provides experience with DevOps practices and showcases your ability to take a project from development to production.
